Had to write cmake file as it is too tough to make write make file for pcl.

********Building with make file********
(with the present make file doesnt work)
Before building make sure that the opencv, pcl(1.6) and its dependencies are installed.
Along with that also make sure that you set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include the pck_config
folder of pcl installation.
In my case it is export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local//lib/pkgconfig/

In case if you wish to use a different vesion of pcl which is not recommended then change the
makefile appropriately and make sure you dont commit the same.
