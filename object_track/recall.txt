I left it at modifying grabcut.cpp
I was trying to reduce the complexity of fg extraction through a video with grabcut.
I wrote a class structure for grabcut in a hope to reuse the models and also some graph structures, as it takes very long to construct graph.
Stuck in some errors arised in class structure that rooted in my poor C++ knowledge.
